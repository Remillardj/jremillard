## About

This is a super simple Jekyll blog with pagination. Although, it is easy to set it up for oneself, it is a bit of a pain to start off with something super simple.
I couldn't find anything that was just this simple, simple as in just a simple masthead, simple posts, simple pagination and simple footer.

My goal was to make this a lightweight and extremely simple web static page generator. So there you go.
