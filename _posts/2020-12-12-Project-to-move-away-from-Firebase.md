# The website setup overall
I set up this website with wanting to integrate CI/CD without too much of a reason other than exposure. I had the student account from Travis CI. Also, I wanted to have HTTPS set up, all in all, this just added additional overhead but the experience was fun. Knowing a commit did a lot behind the scenes to get it to the website. But, it's been awhile and it's time to move on.

## Cost
Firebase costs money although it's not expensive. The horror stories from many founders on beind nearly bankrupt because of the intense Firebase cost to host was something that's made me want to lean away from, especially since there is free options like GitHub pages.

## CI/CD unnecessary work
As cool as it is to use CI/CD, for a blog purpose based on simplicity is just not necessary. I originally intended this website to eventually grow into sharing projects. Upon thinking about it, sharing projects on a personal website makes no sense, at least in the sense of hosting. Why not keep it simple, like on GitHub with README's?

## Project moving forward
Simple. Move off of Firebase and Travis CI to GitHub pages. Might as well as it: free hosting and route my domain to GitHub. Eh, it's late and I've had a few truly's. Let the idea's flow!

## Where will personal projects go?
I got a new site that I want to work on call esseredesigns.com. I plan to put all my creative itches there and any software projects in GitHub. Eventually with this blog I'd like implement data tables and be able to search for blogs. We will see! Kind of tedious work when you're busy but you know what, nothing a few sips of whisky can't solve!
