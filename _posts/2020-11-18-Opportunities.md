# What is it
The difficult part when learning these 'engineering manager' terminology/phisolophy is realistically approaching a subordinate, rather, them approaching you with you setting them up to think they are. Instead of focusing on nuances, the important aspect as an manager is providing opportunities to younger engineers for them to take or not, tasking opportunities to senior engineers, then the middle ground where it's a slight mix of both. A stronger version of providing opportunities and little on the plate of tasking opportunities. How the maximise is the question.

## Problem identification
It's easy to sit back, at least for me, and identify a lot of problems. I approach the system with the customer mindset learned from entrepreneur days; what exactly is it that would attract 'me' as a customer? Seamless/frictionless, intuitive, robustness, etc. The importance varies greatly among peoples experience and goal: straightforward or experience. It's finding the middle ground with the business value in mindset that is important.

## Wordage
Wording your approach is key in moving forward with a solution. Due dilligence needs to be done before laying it on the table but first, getting the person in charge on board. Use their method of incentives against them, tailer it to their ears. As stupid is it may be in this current economy, the concept of tailering each resume for a job is blasphemy. You have no reference on who is looking at the resume as if they always are. You can get a general gist of the 'mission' of a company but frankly it's generic and broad corporate linguistics that realistically attract other businesses. One big hustle. Not to stray away but understand words are powerful, get the gist across in the tailored method.
