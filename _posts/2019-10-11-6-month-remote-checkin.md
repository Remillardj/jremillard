title:	"6 Month Remote Checkin"

It has been a little over 6 months since I've become a remote employee and I have to say that it's flown by. I wrote a post awhile back talking about my journey to becoming a remote worker and frankly it has lived up to everything I have wanted it too. If I was to graph my mood of being in an office compared to working from home, there would be a clear difference in mood whereas being remote is much happier. Now, this isn't to say that I did not like my coworkers or office, infact I really liked them and the office was beautiful, however, it boils down to me. I have a hard time working to my 100% in a busy and open environment, it is just how I was wired.

All my life, environments where there were a lot of stimulates exhausted me quickly, I had to for some reason listen and understand everything. It was frustrating growing up where being required to do school work in class while every one talked made me take forever to finish the assignment but the minute we had quiet time to do so, I always finished first. I am really grateful that I got to become a remote employee at SendGrid, that I am able to play to my strengths.

Working from home is not all glam; hours can be confused, especially within your spouse and yourself. I can find myself working 12 hours a day and a couple days go by when I realize I haven't gotten any vitamin D. This has nothing to do with work demands but rather converting from that standard "I drove to work so now I am working" and "I drove home so now I relax" is not a thing, time can fly by more. There is definitly a learning curve of pacing yourself and creating triggers where you can tell your body you are no longer in work mode.

This is definitely an exciting time of my life, living what I wanted for so many years. A sense of accomplishment has washed me, I am taking some time this weekend to reflect more on the journey, to accept that it's the beginning and there is much more to come.
