## What is investing?
There are tons of resources on what is investing: vehicles such as real estate, stock market, bonds, loans, etc. Plethora of content to understand the general outlets of investing. Many articles do not cover the important topic of investing in of itself besides "make more money by using your money." In reality, look to the ones that are in the real investing game. Not your grandparents or parents, in fact they may not even be in the stock market! Investing is this: there is a risk but what you are doing is helping a company or something grow into something real. Invest in what you believe with understanding of that field and what it is that you're putting your money in. Think of it like this: you can look at the numbers all you want and perhaps long game you will win, but if you're in the short term then there are few things you need to do which I will cover briefly both.

### Short term
When it comes to investing, the key is what is your goal. When you hear the term, you probably think of money, economy, and stocks. Frankly, that's a fa√ßade rather a term with primary usage for that field. I was given a piece of advice which was invest in yourself, as you are the greatest asset. This can be however you may view as beneficial for yourself. Courses for a certificate, exercising, reading self-help books, whatever it may be, ensure it helps you become the best possible you that you want to be. These can be done in quick spikes, however, I do not believe there is such a thing as true short term investing. Everything is a drop in the bucket to fill it up, it's when that investing for that portion ends which can be classified as an arbitrary short term method of investing. Key component is reflection and this goes for both methods. Reflect, reflect, reflect. The trajectory, is it accurate? Are you on par? Is the trajectory in the wrong directory? Do I need to take a couple steps back to take a few steps forward or side step laterally? The questions you ask need to be from you: observe others and create your own fortifying and beneficial questions.

### Long term
Whether it's money, exercising, sport, or academics, what it is, you're in there for long haul. Understand there will be dips, look at any long term stock and you will see highs and lows but always increases over time. That is the goal here and it is applicable to just about anything.

### Conclusion
A short article yes, perhaps not the topic you were expecting, but I want to share and help spread that the idea and concept of investing goes beyond money. You can throw your money in an ETF or index fund with high chances that you'll do fine. But not everyone decides to take a few days of the year to read, write, and make themselves proud.
