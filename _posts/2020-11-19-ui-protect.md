# Ubiquiti
I've been fascinated with the products of Ubiquiti. The capabilities out of the box has been on point with easy home network setup for those with some knowledge. Customizable in some sense to get the job done that I want it too. Obviously other aspects needed like LAN wide adblocker and dnsmasq domain to access servers do not come out of the box with perhaps the most useful machine UI has released, Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro.

## Why?
I absolutely love this machine, creating essentially a VPN to UI's cloud where accessible software within UDMPro is seamless in aspects. I don't have to open up my firewall so I can ssh in with high latency with some failures based on my raspberry pi's VPN. That has been set aside and no longer is necessary. As for integration with the other products, it's overall solid. Of course bugs appear here and there, especially graphical glitches due to outsourcing and cutting costs.

## Laying down cable
Perhaps the most arduous task with setting up a UI home network is cabling. It's all PoE or PnPPoE which can make it difficult because screw injectors. Routing cable in a home where that is non-existant is a pain, drilling holes left and right simply because the house is just too old is non-sense grunt work but satisfying. One thing to note, as useful as the graphs may be with the network software with UI, there are graphical glitches with traffic graphs specific to various devices'. Overall, seamless and effective. I do recommend setting up at least a pi-hole to help block advertisement and use the dnsmasq out of the box that come with it. Raspberry is so cheap, PoE for convenience.
