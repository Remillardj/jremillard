# Alfred!
I've become obsessed with Alfred! Workflows have become incredibly important; streamlining your process makes a difference. I broke down and purchased the power pack, and I do not regret it. Ever since I downloaded and used Spectacles, I have noticed how effective tidy my workspace has become. I always thought; organized cluttered isn't an indication of poor intelligence, but I recently experienced having an organized neat helps me not do mental sorts. To find what I need, I use an index-like database to retrieve what I need quickly. Cardinality is low.

## Anything in specific?
Not really. Accessing commands, files, caching, et all is something I recommend. The difference between not using it and using it is like vanilla bash and zsh with plugins without the overhead.
