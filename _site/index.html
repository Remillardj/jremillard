                <h2 id="post-title">Importance of having a different hobby</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>Three posts in one day, WHAT?!</p>

<p>Yep. Finally had the urge to write some posts, it’s a whenever I can and want kind of thing.</p>

<p>Recently I read an article about the importance of having a side-project, tech related. It is a great read and I do agree that it is important, but one thing I have learned in the recent year is the importance of having a hobby outside of your job field. There is a lot to learn in tech and there always will be, the newest and fanciest tech to the oldest and most fundamental, it’s all great and I love it.</p>

<p>For some, doing some programming on the side of their programming job is fine, they are capable without burnout or can run at that pace for several years before burning out. Power to them. But in a way, that’s a narrow path.</p>

<p>There is much to learn in different industries that can transfer over to the technical industry subconsciously. I recently have been pursuing more a racing hobby, shifter karts to sim racing. Racing is something I have always been really into, Need For Speed: Carbon is what got me hooked on the Audi R8 and has ever since, still is my dream car 13+ years later. It has expanded my skills and I feel like it is making me a much more rounded engineer. It can take my mind off of work so I can refresh for the next work day, it requires an intense amount of focus, very precise timing and immense patience. With it I have learned a lot about cars and character traits, but has helped me understand one very improtant lesson that the senior engineers have been saying to me. It takes time.</p>

<p>There will always be edge cases, accepting that some things just take time is more productive then trying to shove past it. The attitude to be working a tech job and doing tech stuff in your free time might seem like the correct way of working in tech but frankly, it can be silly over time. I love amibitons, dreams and passions, I would never stomp on those, especially since I am like too. I do tech stuff in my free time sometimes but I learned I have got to pace myself to not burn out and doing so it is more effective then constantly pushing through until a breaking point. But no matter how hard I work, some career milestones just take time and there isn’t anything you can do to control that.</p>

<p>The 2019 Russian GP Formula 1 had an example of this, frankly, Formula 1 has a lot of examples. It has shifted over to more older racing drivers to much younger, ranging from 17-18 years old. They are unarguable very talented and have much going for them, many are more skilled than their older peers. However, Charles LeClerc showed the difference between the older F1 drivers and the younger F1 drivers. How Sebastian Vettel handled the situation of Ferrari telling him to let Charles past even though Charles at 1.5 seconds behind with Hamilton just a second behind him and Vettel putting in the fastest lap after each lap. Compare Singapore GP where Charles was immediately upset with being undercut versus Sebastian dealing with Ferrari telling him to let Charles past to even when Vettel’s MGU-K supposedly failed, it was handled with grace and obvious frustration, but he saw the big picture. It is those sideline things that are hard to see when you start out. There isn’t much you can do to learn those things besides pay attention and accept it takes time. Despite how my previous employment ended, which wasn’t necessarily bad but rather I didn’t know how to handle it, there was one thing my boss said to me when I wanting to propose to my now wife when her parents did not approve.</p>

<p>He said, “Think of it like this; you and her are both in the car, on your way somewhere that usually takes 10 minutes. You get stuck in bad traffic and it looks like it’s going to take a few days to get there, but that’s okay because you’re both in the car, going in the same direction.” However applicable to marriage that is, it also seems applicable to career milestones, I am doing the things to get there, for others they may take no time and it might take me awhile, but that’s okay because I am getting there.</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">Creating a mini-uptime</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>One of my big desires growing up was having a homelab. The concept was always such a fascinating and thrilling one for me, the idea of expanding/growth, limitless creativity expressions and building SOMETHING definitely got fired up. And oooh, has that been a reality. I bought a mini server rack since I received a Dell R710 from my previous employment. I didn’t have much use for it before I moved to California, I had to leave it in my home state as I had such limited room and uncertainty of my living situation. When I came back to my home town the idea finally could come to fruition. I started off with a small server rack and my R710. It quickly expanded to an R620, mini-PC and some switches. Doing this has taught me a lot about how exhausting it is to move servers around and bolt together a server rack, but more importantly, it has allowed me to learn beyond my specialties.</p>

<p>Homelabs to me are so important, it creates a sandbox environment where you can play and learn anything and see the fruits of your work. I recently bought a NAS and some Red WD, it hurt the bank. But it was much needed, I tried using GDrive and OneDrive, I just found those cloud storages are such a pain to use for consumer level stuff, it created so many problems like permission issues, shadow copies, disappearing files and not syncing between computers. OneDrive especially, for some reason, all your data needs to be downloaded onto each computer, as if distributed computed isn’t difficult enough… I put in the hours to pull all my personal digital items like photos from the cloud and onto my computers/external hard drives. It’s been scary because my entire livilhood and memories sit on these drives with no redundancy. The money I spent on the NAS and red’s are so worth it because I can finally be in control of my data, no need to download it to every single computer or have syncing issues. It’s right there in my home. The sense of relieve is washing over me. I already have the NAS and the red’s are coming in Monday, I am so excited :)</p>

<p>I really do love having the ability to play around with servers and tech, the no worry of which customers it’s going to affect frees me up to take more risks and learn the limits or hack something together without being judged on the quality. With that comes the barriers that you have to solve, and I love that. When you start to expand more and more, there comes a point where it becomes hard to remember it all and where things are and what they are for and what’s installed. Configuration managers help a lot with this but before installing and configuring something hefty like a config manager, something simple to scale up is a little service discovery app. At least, that’s is what I want to call it. I hacked together a flask app that uses paramiko to log onto my router which uses dnsmasq to resolve local host names (which was a pain to set up at first on a Edge router). It queries the DHCP leases using vbash and returns the output. From there I did a bit more programming and used nmap to figure out what is up and down, jam it into a HTML table. This was something that probably took me a few hours to do but the thrill of learning this all from scratch and seeing that I’m iteratively solving the problems of having several computers talk to each other and managing the devices certainly have transferred some over to a production environment. (Here is the code if you want to look, it’s simple: https://github.com/Remillardj/decouvrir)</p>

<p>Looking at my mini data center makes me happy, limitless creativity and problem solving.</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">6 Month Remote Checkin</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>It has been a little over 6 months since I’ve become a remote employee and I have to say that it’s flown by. I wrote a post awhile back talking about my journey to becoming a remote worker and frankly it has lived up to everything I have wanted it too. If I was to graph my mood of being in an office compared to working from home, there would be a clear difference in mood whereas being remote is much happier. Now, this isn’t to say that I did not like my coworkers or office, infact I really liked them and the office was beautiful, however, it boils down to me. I have a hard time working to my 100% in a busy and open environment, it is just how I was wired.</p>

<p>All my life, environments where there were a lot of stimulates exhausted me quickly, I had to for some reason listen and understand everything. It was frustrating growing up where being required to do school work in class while every one talked made me take forever to finish the assignment but the minute we had quiet time to do so, I always finished first. I am really grateful that I got to become a remote employee at SendGrid, that I am able to play to my strengths.</p>

<p>Working from home is not all glam; hours can be confused, especially within your spouse and yourself. I can find myself working 12 hours a day and a couple days go by when I realize I haven’t gotten any vitamin D. This has nothing to do with work demands but rather converting from that standard “I drove to work so now I am working” and “I drove home so now I relax” is not a thing, time can fly by more. There is definitly a learning curve of pacing yourself and creating triggers where you can tell your body you are no longer in work mode.</p>

<p>This is definitely an exciting time of my life, living what I wanted for so many years. A sense of accomplishment has washed me, I am taking some time this weekend to reflect more on the journey, to accept that it’s the beginning and there is much more to come.</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">Deincentiving Your Employees</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>Awhile ago as I was doing my usually business around my home, puttering around and pondering, I found myself reminiscing upon my past employments in neither a good nor bad light, but reflecting. I often do so to appreciate the journey I have been on, to be grateful for the situation I am in and continue to reset my goals and check off ones I achieved.</p>

<p>During this period of reflection, a natural aspect I look at often is my career growth, to where I was and where I am now. It brought me back to a time where I was employed by a University, my first “big boy” job. I started as a System Administrator for a small university, it was an exciting time of my life. Finally no longer tied to assignments due the next day when assigned at night, or focus on a subject that has no relevancy nor do I have any passion about. I can finally express and learn more on topics I have been wanting to for some time where school was being a blocker for that path.</p>

<p>It was exciting to finally get decent pay, a door started to open and I knew once I got it, it’s much easier to stay in, and the path to obtaining a degree would become less and less relevant. I wanted to explode in growth and knowledge, I wanted to be that sysadmin that the techs looked up to and I would be the one to bring them up and help achieve them of their dreams.</p>

<p>Even before I was hired, the team was understaffed by two for reasons why nobody was hired is unknown. Originally, the team should have consisted of 6 system administrators, one engineer, one manager for our technical support staff and our department director. However, when I was hired on there were 4 system administrators and newly appointed director, where the engineer had left a couple months prior. Horribly understaffed but I figured this was a good opportunity to fly up the ranks. Oh boy, was I wrong.</p>

<p>The first month or two of the employment went great, my name was becoming synonmous with good technical experience, I was becoming more and more vetted as I took on the more difficult problems to solve for the department, knocking problems out of the park. I felt at the time that my boss would be the one who would put their foot forward for me, and with him at the top, I would be unstoppable.</p>

<p>This quickly dwinded, and by quick I mean within a few weeks. One of the system administrators quit, leaving the rest of us to pick up the slack. And then, the coworker who I worked with quit, leaving me to pick up their slack. And then a couple months later, another coworker who was working there for a little longer than I did, who had great technical experience and a great worth ethic and in fact I still look up to today, burnt out. He took on much of the extra work as our team slowly became undercutted and underfunded by the CIO, as he started to take away our funding for our staff and positions. <strong>Within a few months, I became the most senior system administrator.</strong> The coworker who burning out was doing the responsibility of a system adminsitrator and the job of the engineers, to his credit, he did pretty good at it considering this job was requiring 55+ hours a week nonstop. A time came where the fiscal year ended and the potential for promotions was about, instead of bringing back the engineer position and give him that, they denied that saying he will need a few more years experience but offered the senior system administrator position. He declined, and quick left the department soon after, frustrated with all the work he put in, extra hours, only to be denied simply because <em>lack of time in service</em>. My coworker terminating the employment left a big mess.</p>

<p>The mess was not created by them leaving but rather poor management by deincentivizing the team. It was not just the executive decision to withold and take the engineer funding and place it on another team unnecessarily, but within my employment there the school announced that any employee that met a certain salary threshold will have no raises at all, including costs of living adjustments. This meant that some peoples salaries will continue to grow as some will decrease due to influation.</p>

<p>When my coworker left, he left behind all the responsibilities he took. Ultimately, majority of it landed on my shoulders. Somehow, within a few months I became the most senior system administrator that was taking nearly 4x the amount of responsibilities as I originally joined. I buckled down as I figured this was an opportunity to rise up, I kept pushing to get new hires and held down the fort. I talked to my boss about being promoted to senior sysadmin as it has historically been done when the senior sysadmin leaves, it is handed to the next more tenured staff member. He denied saying to give him ammo, I need to continue to do this for a little longer. So I buckled down and held the fort to the best of my ability, training dozens of new techs, a couple of new hires, while maintaining my responsibilities and the engineering duties which started to become redundant but overwhelming with the amount of work that was coming in. I felt the fringe of burn out within a couple of months and decided its time to talk to my boss about possibly getting promoted as I felt that would continue to motivate me and allow me to move into an area where I could learn more technical things.</p>

<p>I gave my pitch, describing the duties and amount of work I have as well as I have completed. My accomplishments while maintaining these duties and still getting compliments from customers. I thought there was no way I could not be promoted, everything in the stars seemed to align, but my director came back saying I needed to maintain where I am for a few more years before we can consider a promotion. I tried to pass off some responsibilities since I knew I could not be running at the rate I was, but I was cutshort. Unfortunately, the work load became so much I did not have time to pass off any responsibilities while training them, and the new hires were unable to pick up fast enough. Customers started to complain as I was split between so many different responsibilities and managing so many deadlines, my mind started to crumble. I stayed for a little bit longer, but it wasn’t too much later after my discussion with the director when I started to look for a new job. I was unhappy, I felt stuck.</p>

<p>There was no longer any motivation of any kind. My pay would decrease because of inflation even though my responsibilities 4x’d within a few months, I was the most senior system administrator and people getting hired were getting paid more than me even though I denied a raise.</p>

<p>The fastest way to make your employees burn out and leave you in the dust is taking away their pay, expecting more responsibility to be added to their plate, tell them they need to keep at this responsibility level that is 4x more than hired on for a few years as a promise to promote and hire people with higher pay. Despite the numerous talks to our director and CIO about the situation, nothing changed. During my employment there, we were never fully staffed. When I decided to leave, 2 other coworkers left alongside me, that finally put up big enough flag for our CIO to ask what was going on in that department.</p>

<p>I do not blame my manager at all, he was new to management and beginning to figure it out. But if you are becoming a manager, learn from his mistake, do not worry about building strong clout first. Politics in IT can be quite the intense game but I think there is a time and place for that, when your team is understaffed for some time and burning out, focusing on your clout is not the time. Your employees are what run the company ultimately, so focus on retaining and building them instead of trying to have a strong voice with your boss.</p>

<p>To reiterate, this was my experience and opinion. If you don’t like it you can just close this tab, thanks!</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">Using Firebase To Host Websites</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>Recently I had an itch to create websites again, in search of eventually creating a SaaS, but in order to do so, I need to have the design down. Web design was something I enjoyed deeply over a decade ago, using w3 schools to learn html and learning how file structures work. It is my old homage and a comfort zone when it comes to computers. It has been a while since I designed something, especially for a purpose, so to satisfy that itch I decided to dedicate a weekend to doing so, seeing how much I can pick up web development again.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues I found when I started web development was hosting solutions. Any free-tier based web hosting is always crap and it only gets worse from there. I knew AWS has the ability to host static websites, and AWS is a topic I wanted to learn more in so I decided to delve into it.</p>

<p>As I log into my old account, I realize I was actually getting billed for SOMETHING, still not sure what since everything was shutdown and deleted. I logged into my GCP account and realized I had that $300 credit available to my account and asked myself if its possible to host a static website using GCP, and it is possible.</p>

<p>It is so simple to set something like that up, just some simple rerouting and setting buckets available, but unfortunately something I eventually noticed was that it only allows HTTP and not HTTPS. Bummer. And the more I looked into how to get an HTTPS certificate for my website, the more complicated it got with setting up loadbalancers, etc. I wanted a cheap, near free, solution to just host some pictures, html, css and maybe a tiny tiny bit of javascript.</p>

<p>I knew static hosting via GCP was not going to be enough, I also did not want to use GitHub to host my site even though that it possible and it does issue HTTPS certificates, I wanted it to be a little bit more hidden than a public repository. I dug around and found Firebase, a Google product that can host static websites, both HTTP and HTTPS. This was a winner.</p>

<p>It was so easy to integrate Travis CI with GitHub to deploy to Firebase. Only took a few hours to get that running and set up MX records to point to my firebase website. If you have a website that is simple and does not need a lot of traffic, Firebase is the way to go.</p>

<p>The biggest downside to using Firebase is there is a download cap, anyone viewing your website will require downloading data which will cost you money. If you have that $300 credit, you can use that for your website, however, there is a free tier of Firebase which if you do not need a lot of web traffic, this is a great solution. Feel free to take a look at the repo, particularly the travis.yml and firebase.json on how I set up Travis CI to Firebase.</p>
