<p>It’s been some time since I’ve even bothered with this site, but that needs to change. I’ve been in the zone the past half year and just now I feel like its time to make drastic changes to how I want this site to function. I have plans in the works now but hopefully I can actually see it through.</p>

<p>It’s been some time since I’ve wrote an article, I tried to get myself to write one a few times but never could. It felt like I had to derive what I had and made it look like it’s purpose was to get jobs or money, something of value instead of having personal value. I didn’t want to move away from that, the simplicity of my blog is exactly what I like. It’s Ruby Jekyll with Markdown posts that get stored on GitHub. There is no search bar, just pagination and simple colors. To move away and to “update” it would make it feel like it would be the death of my intention of this site from the start. It is a place for me to learn and reflect back on what I thought was worthy and purpose later write about things that I thought were not worthy but was.</p>

                    <h1 id="the-website-setup-overall">The website setup overall</h1>
<p>I set up this website with wanting to integrate CI/CD without too much of a reason other than exposure. I had the student account from Travis CI. Also, I wanted to have HTTPS set up, all in all, this just added additional overhead but the experience was fun. Knowing a commit did a lot behind the scenes to get it to the website. But, it’s been awhile and it’s time to move on.</p>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>
<p>Firebase costs money although it’s not expensive. The horror stories from many founders on beind nearly bankrupt because of the intense Firebase cost to host was something that’s made me want to lean away from, especially since there is free options like GitHub pages.</p>

<h2 id="cicd-unnecessary-work">CI/CD unnecessary work</h2>
<p>As cool as it is to use CI/CD, for a blog purpose based on simplicity is just not necessary. I originally intended this website to eventually grow into sharing projects. Upon thinking about it, sharing projects on a personal website makes no sense, at least in the sense of hosting. Why not keep it simple, like on GitHub with README’s?</p>

<h2 id="project-moving-forward">Project moving forward</h2>
<p>Simple. Move off of Firebase and Travis CI to GitHub pages. Might as well as it: free hosting and route my domain to GitHub. Eh, it’s late and I’ve had a few truly’s. Let the idea’s flow!</p>

<h2 id="where-will-personal-projects-go">Where will personal projects go?</h2>
<p>I got a new site that I want to work on call esseredesigns.com. I plan to put all my creative itches there and any software projects in GitHub. Eventually with this blog I’d like implement data tables and be able to search for blogs. We will see! Kind of tedious work when you’re busy but you know what, nothing a few sips of whisky can’t solve!</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">Basic Investing For Beginners</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <h2 id="what-is-investing">What is investing?</h2>
<p>There are tons of resources on what is investing: vehicles such as real estate, stock market, bonds, loans, etc. Plethora of content to understand the general outlets of investing. Many articles do not cover the important topic of investing in of itself besides “make more money by using your money.” In reality, look to the ones that are in the real investing game. Not your grandparents or parents, in fact they may not even be in the stock market! Investing is this: there is a risk but what you are doing is helping a company or something grow into something real. Invest in what you believe with understanding of that field and what it is that you’re putting your money in. Think of it like this: you can look at the numbers all you want and perhaps long game you will win, but if you’re in the short term then there are few things you need to do which I will cover briefly both.</p>

<h3 id="short-term">Short term</h3>
<p>When it comes to investing, the key is what is your goal. When you hear the term, you probably think of money, economy, and stocks. Frankly, that’s a façade rather a term with primary usage for that field. I was given a piece of advice which was invest in yourself, as you are the greatest asset. This can be however you may view as beneficial for yourself. Courses for a certificate, exercising, reading self-help books, whatever it may be, ensure it helps you become the best possible you that you want to be. These can be done in quick spikes, however, I do not believe there is such a thing as true short term investing. Everything is a drop in the bucket to fill it up, it’s when that investing for that portion ends which can be classified as an arbitrary short term method of investing. Key component is reflection and this goes for both methods. Reflect, reflect, reflect. The trajectory, is it accurate? Are you on par? Is the trajectory in the wrong directory? Do I need to take a couple steps back to take a few steps forward or side step laterally? The questions you ask need to be from you: observe others and create your own fortifying and beneficial questions.</p>

<h3 id="long-term">Long term</h3>
<p>Whether it’s money, exercising, sport, or academics, what it is, you’re in there for long haul. Understand there will be dips, look at any long term stock and you will see highs and lows but always increases over time. That is the goal here and it is applicable to just about anything.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>A short article yes, perhaps not the topic you were expecting, but I want to share and help spread that the idea and concept of investing goes beyond money. You can throw your money in an ETF or index fund with high chances that you’ll do fine. But not everyone decides to take a few days of the year to read, write, and make themselves proud.</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">Hinting Indexes in MySQL</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <h1 id="mysql-itself">MySQL itself</h1>
<p>Look, MySQL is a solid and if not the most capable relational database. Quite the broad statement but it’s true to an extent. It does have limitations and should not be treated as a key / value database as well as data warehouse. It is a relational database, great for decent scaling with capabilities of impressive IOPS.</p>

<h2 id="onto-the-issue">Onto the issue</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, developers do not and personally should not understand the inner workings of MySQL. However, if advised and treated as a non-relational database then that is where the issue comes into play. Allowing customers to abuse a feature that was briefly introduced as a professional services product due to a request of a high MRR customers. To reiterate and be clear, <em>this has no impact, no representation of my work/day job</em>. Now, onto the issue. The misunderstanding and perhaps politics in play cause headaches later. When clustered indexs are in, unfortunately there are things in MySQL related to SQL that the MySQL optimizer may think it is indeed doing the best possible query to the database. However, there are cases where lack of indexes rather incorrect index may cause overflow of searched an extra partition or however many extra rows, decreasing overall effiency and response times. How to fix this? To note: I said hint. In the end, the optimizer decides what it wants to do. But with SQL you can either force or ask the optimizer to use a specific index instead of a range.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>select * from <em>table</em> use index (idx);</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simple yeah? Reiterate: this is hinting. You could force but that may have unintentional consequences. Always refer to the documentation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/optimizer-hints.html</li>
  <li>https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/index-hints.html</li>
</ul>

<p>This is just one part in a very complicated table of optimization. Keep in mind there is only so much you can do and constantly tuning the database without the need may not be a good approach in keeping high availability and robustness.</p>
