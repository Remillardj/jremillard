                <h2 id="post-title">Deincentiving Your Employees</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>Awhile ago as I was doing my usually business around my home, puttering around and pondering, I found myself reminiscing upon my past employments in neither a good nor bad light, but reflecting. I often do so to appreciate the journey I have been on, to be grateful for the situation I am in and continue to reset my goals and check off ones I achieved.</p>

<p>During this period of reflection, a natural aspect I look at often is my career growth, to where I was and where I am now. It brought me back to a time where I was employed by a University, my first “big boy” job. I started as a System Administrator for a small university, it was an exciting time of my life. Finally no longer tied to assignments due the next day when assigned at night, or focus on a subject that has no relevancy nor do I have any passion about. I can finally express and learn more on topics I have been wanting to for some time where school was being a blocker for that path.</p>

<p>It was exciting to finally get decent pay, a door started to open and I knew once I got it, it’s much easier to stay in, and the path to obtaining a degree would become less and less relevant. I wanted to explode in growth and knowledge, I wanted to be that sysadmin that the techs looked up to and I would be the one to bring them up and help achieve them of their dreams.</p>

<p>Even before I was hired, the team was understaffed by two for reasons why nobody was hired is unknown. Originally, the team should have consisted of 6 system administrators, one engineer, one manager for our technical support staff and our department director. However, when I was hired on there were 4 system administrators and newly appointed director, where the engineer had left a couple months prior. Horribly understaffed but I figured this was a good opportunity to fly up the ranks. Oh boy, was I wrong.</p>

<p>The first month or two of the employment went great, my name was becoming synonmous with good technical experience, I was becoming more and more vetted as I took on the more difficult problems to solve for the department, knocking problems out of the park. I felt at the time that my boss would be the one who would put their foot forward for me, and with him at the top, I would be unstoppable.</p>

<p>This quickly dwinded, and by quick I mean within a few weeks. One of the system administrators quit, leaving the rest of us to pick up the slack. And then, the coworker who I worked with quit, leaving me to pick up their slack. And then a couple months later, another coworker who was working there for a little longer than I did, who had great technical experience and a great worth ethic and in fact I still look up to today, burnt out. He took on much of the extra work as our team slowly became undercutted and underfunded by the CIO, as he started to take away our funding for our staff and positions. <strong>Within a few months, I became the most senior system administrator.</strong> The coworker who burning out was doing the responsibility of a system adminsitrator and the job of the engineers, to his credit, he did pretty good at it considering this job was requiring 55+ hours a week nonstop. A time came where the fiscal year ended and the potential for promotions was about, instead of bringing back the engineer position and give him that, they denied that saying he will need a few more years experience but offered the senior system administrator position. He declined, and quick left the department soon after, frustrated with all the work he put in, extra hours, only to be denied simply because <em>lack of time in service</em>. My coworker terminating the employment left a big mess.</p>

<p>The mess was not created by them leaving but rather poor management by deincentivizing the team. It was not just the executive decision to withold and take the engineer funding and place it on another team unnecessarily, but within my employment there the school announced that any employee that met a certain salary threshold will have no raises at all, including costs of living adjustments. This meant that some peoples salaries will continue to grow as some will decrease due to influation.</p>

<p>When my coworker left, he left behind all the responsibilities he took. Ultimately, majority of it landed on my shoulders. Somehow, within a few months I became the most senior system administrator that was taking nearly 4x the amount of responsibilities as I originally joined. I buckled down as I figured this was an opportunity to rise up, I kept pushing to get new hires and held down the fort. I talked to my boss about being promoted to senior sysadmin as it has historically been done when the senior sysadmin leaves, it is handed to the next more tenured staff member. He denied saying to give him ammo, I need to continue to do this for a little longer. So I buckled down and held the fort to the best of my ability, training dozens of new techs, a couple of new hires, while maintaining my responsibilities and the engineering duties which started to become redundant but overwhelming with the amount of work that was coming in. I felt the fringe of burn out within a couple of months and decided its time to talk to my boss about possibly getting promoted as I felt that would continue to motivate me and allow me to move into an area where I could learn more technical things.</p>

<p>I gave my pitch, describing the duties and amount of work I have as well as I have completed. My accomplishments while maintaining these duties and still getting compliments from customers. I thought there was no way I could not be promoted, everything in the stars seemed to align, but my director came back saying I needed to maintain where I am for a few more years before we can consider a promotion. I tried to pass off some responsibilities since I knew I could not be running at the rate I was, but I was cutshort. Unfortunately, the work load became so much I did not have time to pass off any responsibilities while training them, and the new hires were unable to pick up fast enough. Customers started to complain as I was split between so many different responsibilities and managing so many deadlines, my mind started to crumble. I stayed for a little bit longer, but it wasn’t too much later after my discussion with the director when I started to look for a new job. I was unhappy, I felt stuck.</p>

<p>There was no longer any motivation of any kind. My pay would decrease because of inflation even though my responsibilities 4x’d within a few months, I was the most senior system administrator and people getting hired were getting paid more than me even though I denied a raise.</p>

<p>The fastest way to make your employees burn out and leave you in the dust is taking away their pay, expecting more responsibility to be added to their plate, tell them they need to keep at this responsibility level that is 4x more than hired on for a few years as a promise to promote and hire people with higher pay. Despite the numerous talks to our director and CIO about the situation, nothing changed. During my employment there, we were never fully staffed. When I decided to leave, 2 other coworkers left alongside me, that finally put up big enough flag for our CIO to ask what was going on in that department.</p>

<p>I do not blame my manager at all, he was new to management and beginning to figure it out. But if you are becoming a manager, learn from his mistake, do not worry about building strong clout first. Politics in IT can be quite the intense game but I think there is a time and place for that, when your team is understaffed for some time and burning out, focusing on your clout is not the time. Your employees are what run the company ultimately, so focus on retaining and building them instead of trying to have a strong voice with your boss.</p>

<p>To reiterate, this was my experience and opinion. If you don’t like it you can just close this tab, thanks!</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">Using Firebase To Host Websites</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>Recently I had an itch to create websites again, in search of eventually creating a SaaS, but in order to do so, I need to have the design down. Web design was something I enjoyed deeply over a decade ago, using w3 schools to learn html and learning how file structures work. It is my old homage and a comfort zone when it comes to computers. It has been a while since I designed something, especially for a purpose, so to satisfy that itch I decided to dedicate a weekend to doing so, seeing how much I can pick up web development again.</p>

<p>One of the biggest issues I found when I started web development was hosting solutions. Any free-tier based web hosting is always crap and it only gets worse from there. I knew AWS has the ability to host static websites, and AWS is a topic I wanted to learn more in so I decided to delve into it.</p>

<p>As I log into my old account, I realize I was actually getting billed for SOMETHING, still not sure what since everything was shutdown and deleted. I logged into my GCP account and realized I had that $300 credit available to my account and asked myself if its possible to host a static website using GCP, and it is possible.</p>

<p>It is so simple to set something like that up, just some simple rerouting and setting buckets available, but unfortunately something I eventually noticed was that it only allows HTTP and not HTTPS. Bummer. And the more I looked into how to get an HTTPS certificate for my website, the more complicated it got with setting up loadbalancers, etc. I wanted a cheap, near free, solution to just host some pictures, html, css and maybe a tiny tiny bit of javascript.</p>

<p>I knew static hosting via GCP was not going to be enough, I also did not want to use GitHub to host my site even though that it possible and it does issue HTTPS certificates, I wanted it to be a little bit more hidden than a public repository. I dug around and found Firebase, a Google product that can host static websites, both HTTP and HTTPS. This was a winner.</p>

<p>It was so easy to integrate Travis CI with GitHub to deploy to Firebase. Only took a few hours to get that running and set up MX records to point to my firebase website. If you have a website that is simple and does not need a lot of traffic, Firebase is the way to go.</p>

<p>The biggest downside to using Firebase is there is a download cap, anyone viewing your website will require downloading data which will cost you money. If you have that $300 credit, you can use that for your website, however, there is a free tier of Firebase which if you do not need a lot of web traffic, this is a great solution. Feel free to take a look at the repo, particularly the travis.yml and firebase.json on how I set up Travis CI to Firebase.</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">Becoming A Remote Employee Within A Year</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>I started working at SendGrid a little over a year ago, moving from my hometown to Orange County, California. I took this opportunity because at the time I did not have any commitments or responsibilities chaining me to my hometown, making it the perfect opportunity to pick up my belongings and move to a whole new city.</p>

<p>It was a fantastic experience, a sense of freedom and adulthood that comes from packing up your tiny sedan, driving out of state and into a new one, to a new city, sight unseen. Although being in the office of Orange County was a requirement for my new job, I found moving was a critical experience to building my character in every facet and was a catalyst to <em>feeling</em> like an adult, however, I had unfinished plans in my hometown, I knew moving to a whole new region of the United States would cause tension with maintaining relationships in my hometown. Within the first week of working at SendGrid I reiterated my hopes of moving back and working remote to my boss during our first one to one meeting. I appreciated my boss, he was upfront about wanting to get us to that point where I could be remote but was skeptical that it could be done within a year. However, I persisted.</p>

<p>Working remote has always fascinated me even before the start of my career, hearing that an employee was working from home painted an image in my mind of wearing pajamas with a cup of coffee, cooking breakfast for my significant other while in a meeting and having a ton of energy to exercise after work in lieu of commute times. As I advanced in my career, the idea of working from home fascinated me grew deeper, I dug into the day in the life, reading email articles from <a href="https://remotive.io/">Remotive</a>, and the more I learned the facts about working remote, that picture in my head quickly shattered. It is not at all what many think it may be, although, the shattered image of working from home did not shatter my desire, for my desire grew. I wanted to chase after that lifestyle.</p>

<p><img src="/img/1*QhYYRTqViztTZc8Snke3mA.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here’s an image just because ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are a lot of caveats for working remotely, some downsides and some upsides. However, there is something I feel like many prospective employees who wish to be remote tend to ignore this honest fact: working remotely is not for everyone. It is a matter of your work style and self-discipline, this is not to say some people may not ever have the opportunity to work from home permanently. Working remote is very much of a self-starter/self-motivation type of employment, it can be cultivated within oneself, however, trying to cultivate it while in the process of currently being a remote employee will most likely be the cause of decreased work performance. Ultimately, being a remote employee takes a great amount of continuing trust on both the employee and employer, that the quality of work is solid.</p>

<p>After learning more about what it really is like to work remote, I wanted to begin to cultivate the discipline to be a successful and trustful employee of a company. Well before I even applied to SendGrid I started to work towards building my character in those key components, it was not an easy journey but <em>WHEW</em>, has it been worth it!</p>

<h3 id="being-a-trustworthy-student">Being a trustworthy student</h3>

<p>One of the things I did to build my work ethic to be more aligned with a remote employee was transferring to an online education platform. Attending school physically has been a driving factor for many universities, especially regarding their location, priding themselves for emphasizing a strong hands-on teaching method. Fortunately, my field of study does not require a physical presence, regardless of what universities may believe and state, the ability for me to learn material should not be dependent on my ability to attend a classroom from a specified time as designated from the university, especially since majority of the content that is structured to learn for my field of study is based on textbooks that I could read at any time. Understandably, the physical attendance is a discipline aspect of education, to allow a student an environment to be physically present to learn the material but also allow questions to be directly asked to the professor, which is how a majority of students learn. When looking into developing characteristics that would make me a good remote employee, the very concept of being a trustworthy student came to my mind, to still be learning the material and completing assignments regardless of a physical presence. In short, I am not stating I skipped class just to prove myself a point, if anything that is contradictory to what a trustworthy student would be. The first step in becoming a trustworthy remote employee would be aligned with being a trusted student where the physical presence is not required. I moved from an on-campus university to an online university called Western Governors University. There is a steep learning curve in learning how to learn online without a teacher physically present, it took some practice but it does force you to be a self-starter, to learn material without a teacher telling you to do assignments. Not to mention the added benefit of no physical location is that tuition is drastically cheaper than a standard four-year university!</p>

<h3 id="being-a-self-starter">Being a self-starter</h3>

<p>I have always been someone who easily becomes intrigued in a topic and that becomes my world for some time. Some topics stick and some don’t, however, one that did stick is programming. I started to program when I was 12 years old after being introduced to it from a friend I met online. A whole world unlocked before my eyes, that what I saw on a computer is not what it actually looks like but is visualized and brought to life through hundreds of thousands lines of code. That absolutely blew me away. The more curious I become with how something on a website or in an application worked, the more motivated I was to dig into it further. This trait has been so helpful in becoming a full-time remote employee, I was able to demonstrate to my employer that butts-in-seat is not required for me to complete my tasks, that I naturally dig deeper to learn and solve a problem, all that is perceived as a trait of a self-starter.</p>

<h3 id="being-persistent">Being persistent</h3>

<p>I would not be successful in becoming an on-premise to remote employee if it wasn’t for my amazing boss who constantly batted for me and supported my goal in every possible way. During my interview at SendGrid and my first week of employment, I was upfront about wanting to work remote which I believe being honest with my intentions from the start allowed a positive platform to discuss the possibility of transition from an office to remote worker. Quickly after I had conversations with my boss and the principal engineer on my team about working towards achieving that transition. I appreciated how they both wanted me to achieve my goal as well as made it their goal as well, however, they were honest in the uncertainty of reaching that within a year as an entry-level engineer. Regardless, we devised a plan to work towards readiness for working remotely and planned to take it one step at a time. Nearly every other week I would discuss with my manager my readiness for remote, we trialed various techniques to become remote ready and provide ammunition for discussion with higher-ups. Some of the things we tried in a different state, slowly working my up with the number of days I would work from home in a week to meeting our director for further discussions and process of transitioning. Overall, I could not stay as persistent as I did if it was not for my amazing and supportive team.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

<p>It has taken quite some time with a slow progression of proof that working from home does not decrease my productivity and quality of work, and with quite a bit of discussions with my manager and my team, I was fortunately given the opportunity to work remotely within a year of my employment. I am excited to see what this can produce in my career. My hope of this article is to advocate remote work by explaining from an employees point of view to employers and advocate amendments to their policies on allowing remote work as well as encourage employers and employees to build trust within each other.</p>

                <h2 id="post-title">Productivity</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    <p>If you’re anything like me, there is so much in this world that you want to learn, do, or create. But frankly, we just don’t have the luxurious time to do so in our life. What we can control is implementing productivity habits with the limited time we have to efficiently spend our opportunity free time.</p>

<p><img src="/img/1*03trDcoAOygoWW6eU3Kz9g.jpeg" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Time is ticking…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being productive is a product of having good time management skills. Good time management is a learned habit, ironically it takes time to become efficient at with a dash of determination and perseverance, two things that can make us feel like we are wasting time. It helped me with this mindset of overcoming the feeling of wasting time by working on time management by understanding and referring to examples in my life that I took, when I had to take a step back to take two steps forward or sidestep onto a road where I can take many steps forward compared the previous road. I wanted to share a few things that helped me become more productivity and progress with hobbies or my careers exponentially, hopefully, the things I learned will benefit you the same way.</p>

<h3 id="calendar-notifications">Calendar Notifications</h3>

<p>I always figured getting notifications from my calendar would become a nuisance, I already get frustrated with all the email, text, and phone call notifications I receive, I figured adding more to that noise would be a pointless addition to my goal for better time management. Luckily, I decided I need to stop assuming and give it a shot. After all, setting up and configuring would take me an hour top, and deconstructing the calendar notifications would a total of five minutes, what is the harm? I decided a Sunday night before the work week, I set aside an hour to set up my calendar on my phone and laptop, setting time aside for everything I needed to do this week, as well as putting in reoccurring blocks such as work or appointments I had. Here is the caveat I believe that distinguished the usefulness of using a calendar with my phone rather than a physical calendar: I set up reminders. I learned after many years of running back to back with meetings, appointments, work, sports, and many other things, is always during those events I was always thinking what I had to do next, or what I had to do the next day, or how I can do it. Simply, finding that sweet spot of a reminder that helped me remember what is next and not to worry, was a trial and error. A 15-minute reminder was all I needed to know what is next, to start to prepare for that mentally and physically. The most important part of this time management activity is I set up a reoccurring event every Sunday, I would block out an hour to review and add, edit, delete calendar events for that week. Doing this requires discipline, it belongs to the idea of picking up as you go which is often referred to cleaning up the hour, which happily marries alongside with cleaning up your calendar, your weekly schedule needs grooming too! Getting a notification on my phone and my laptop was enough where I wouldn’t forget about my notification but rather I was able to use that time to prepare myself for the next event, which alleviated the stress and helped me compartmentalize my day, which leads me to my next learned lesson.</p>

<h3 id="compartmentalization">Compartmentalization</h3>

<p>This concept is a relatively new concept that I was introduced while having a conversation with one of my boss’ about how the meetings back to back all day with no breaks was burning me out. Although I do think everyone is aware of this method unconsciously, very rarely do any of us actively put it into practice consciously. It really helped me to put this concept into practice when I accepted that I was not good at multitasking, how I produced much better results and quality work when I focused on something 100%, rather than two tasks at 50% each. The return on investment (ROI) for compartmentalizing my time and energy seemed much higher when focused on one task rather than anything more than that. That alone was enough to convince me that this is something would help me benefit my time as I had more energy and focus for the many other things I had or wanted to do in the day. On top of this, this has helped me a lot with being more present with where I am at, honestly, this has helped me a lot of relationships. Focusing on the time now I have with them instead of what I need to be doing in an hour from then. Whatever I have to do in an hour is in an hour. Now, there is a caveat. Having too long of focus time during compartmentalization can backfire, I learned if I focused on one thing for too long it actually wears you out. Make sure you always find a healthy middle!</p>

<h3 id="pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro Technique</h3>

<p>This is most likely the more well-known method for time management and maximizing productivity. However, I would delve into this deeper on the benefits and return on investment (ROI) for this, but C<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-work-40-hours-in-16-7-d9038681e652">hris Winfield does an amazing job on how this works,</a> describing how to work 40 hours in 16.7 hours as well as shares his personal experience of the journey to finding that healthy middle when using this technique. Rather instead of reiterating what he said, I encourage you to go read his article and give it some claps! Luckily, I come from a technical background and was able to program my own Pomodoro clock, however, there are plenty of online websites that implement this just as well.</p>

<p><img src="/img/1*ojHAJr6qL005Bz-kDHlrag.jpeg" alt="" />Picturing things while meditating can help you clear your mind</p>

<h3 id="this-is-counter-intuitive-but-trustme">This Is Counter-Intuitive, But Trust Me</h3>

<p>I think one thing that many articles seem to miss about time management and productivity is actually managing the stress by taking time to yourself. If the idea of how the ROI is better when you put 100% effort and focus on something instead of multiple tasks with a fraction of your focus, then how can you maintain that level without burning out and keeping a high productivity level? Ultimately, we all need to recharge our batteries regardless of our “verted” versions of ourselves, introverted and extroverted, both sides are neither 100% of one, therefore there are times we need to relax and take time to other things. My father once told me that in life, it is good to have three things to tend too. Family, Work, and You. To this day, I do not necessarily agree I can’t have more than one “you”, I can have several hobbies and projects at the same time happily, but rather they are primarily all things that do not require time deadlines as well as I refuse to put pressure on myself to complete those projects on a strict early deadline. However, I do find the general sentiment of three things in your life a happy medium for me. It was a trial and error process to find that number, but I believe having that balance can lead to better productivity and progress in each facet of your life. Some of the things that have greatly helped me with productivity is actually setting a time in my weekly schedule where I block out two one hour times where I meditate. Meditate on my thoughts, feelings, actions, overall oneself. I do admit this was one of the most difficult actions I did to help me become better at time management and productivity, the idea of sitting and doing nothing was nothing more than grinding metal against metal, it was gritty in my mind. Once I overcame that mentality and accepted that time to myself to better myself would help my overall life happiness, balance, reflect, and progress, and again, referred to the times that meditating helped me succeed in those areas, it became an event that I looked forward too. An hour of silence can be the most blissful time of your week, helping you move forward past those barriers in your heart and mind.</p>

<h3 id="ending">Ending</h3>

<p>There are many different techniques and habits you can build that are more narrowed down to what works for you. Everyone is different, what works for me works for me, but you can use these techniques as a framework to do trial and error for what works for you. Frequent reflection and analyzing how things are going for the different planes of your life while learning time management and productivity tips are part of the process of becoming more efficient. No one wakes up one morning after a night of attempting to become more productive, is automatically extremely productivity consistently. Remember that this should be a marathon, not a race. Burning yourself out is the exact opposite of what you want, in fact, that could set you back further then where you would be if you try to be productive at all. However, the feeling of being productive and seeing your progress is worth the attempts at becoming a marathon productivist.</p>

<p>Since becoming a DBA, I have learned that something as simple as a backup can actually come with a lot of caveats that may not have simple solutions. In my mind beforehand and have worked at other tech places, backing up data was a simple backup to a cloud storage or a SAN drive of some sort. You back it up once a day or once a week, that is it. If something happened such as file went missing or someone lost their computer, we can just roll back with what we got on file. However, since becoming a DBA, there are many different hurdles I never thought of or considered, especially when it comes to a high availability environment with high SLA’s. Here are 4 things to consider when creating your backup system.</p>

<h3 id="1-availability">1. Availability</h3>

<p>The first point encompasses different aspects when it comes to availability, however, there are three primary points I want to hit on when it comes to this topic. The first aspect to think about is how accessible are your backups. If the only backups you keep are an off-site cold storage, that will be a bottleneck if there ever is a case where backups are required to bring a service online. This is typically well known not to only have off-site backups and not practiced often, but I have seen cases where that is the only way to obtain certain files and documents. Another aspect is the latency of the backup server. If the backup server is one that is on the backlog, neglected, with the oldest and outdated switch, this will cause issues of unavailability of the backup, as well as a lengthy disaster recovery process taking hours to access. Lastly, the question to ask yourself is how long would it take you from the point of learning that you will have to recover the backup, to actually getting it implemented and accessed by the service. This is in consideration of both points listed above but may also consider the method of accessing the backup.</p>

<h3 id="2-datarecovery">2. Data Recovery</h3>

<p>This point is not talking about bottlenecks or recommendations for disaster recovery, but rather a thought exercise of the availability of data for a disaster or a recovery process. Something to think about when creating a backup system is the frequency of the backups being created and the critical data that is being generated or collected from the point of a data loss and the latest backup. Say, backups are created at midnight every day, but sometime afterward data is corrupted, therefore any work done for that day is gone. How do you prevent that from happening? Understandably, there is little you can do to prevent several minutes of data corruption, there may be times where that is the best a company can do. However, this is something to think about, how to prevent data corruption from ruining an entire day worth of work.</p>

<h3 id="3-hardware-and-softwarefailures">3. Hardware and software failures</h3>

<p>A simple answer to preventing hardware and software failures is making backups upon backups, on several different servers in several different regions of the world. However, these still happen and can still erase important data. Any part of the entire stack can fail: the backup software or script, the backup server, the archive server hard drives, network connections, a bad commit or bad query, server overload, even drive space which can fill up overnight. Layout the most critical parts of the backup systems’ stack, and implement tools to monitor and self-correct when issues arise. Always maintain off-site external backups, and create policies for data retention.</p>

<h3 id="4-scalability">4. Scalability</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, as the company and software grow, so will databases and backup sizes. With this comes a reiterated set of problems, especially with where on the stack is the system going to be overloaded, and where is expansion going to alleviate the most. Best practices to scale your scalability to implement good third-party monitoring software for just about any part of the stack, network with our database administrators with how they solved problems, and stress test your backup system to see where faults pop up.</p>

<h3 id="ending">Ending</h3>

<p>Hopefully, these points to look for were helpful and gave you some food for thought. Just remember, databases are some of the most complicated parts of the services and software, DBA’s handle a lot more than perceived.</p>
