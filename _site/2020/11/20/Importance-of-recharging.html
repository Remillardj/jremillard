<p>Every once in awhile, every engineer will encounter a time of fatigue. However, the difference between a junior and more experience engineer is noticing onset fatigue. It is important to understand your symptoms of fatigue, mainly understanding why the business value here is incredible. Allowing emplyoees to continue to work regardless of energy levels will the end produce poor quality work leading to a spiral downpour of systems lacking reliability and increase oversight, therefore downtimes and further fatigue. Allowing yourself time to recharge encompasses wholly the emotional intelligence by identifying <em>BEFORE</em> it onsets.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-some-symptoms-rather-how-to-identify">What are some symptoms? Rather, how to identify?</h2>
<p>Without looking online for true symptoms, I’d rather talk about myself since it is my opinion therefore does not require any kind of scientific study background.</p>

<h3 id="key-step-one">Key step one</h3>
<p>Trial and error has been one of my strong suites. Since learning web development back in when I was 12, the resources for online learning was lacking. W3schools and perhaps random forums where caveats were pointed out by experience developers. I took that without documenting it myself and somehow took away a decent chunk of knowledge. So in this case, step one is persistence.</p>

<h3 id="key-step-two">Key step two</h3>
<p>Listening. We speak too much, we talk to much. “How to win friends and influence people” by Dale Carnegie highlights key components in building modular relationships is <em>LISTENING</em>. Not only that, but understand. Truly map it out. Listen to your body. Mentally, emotionally, physically, sleep patterns.</p>

<h3 id="key-step-three">Key step three</h3>
<p>Identify your refreshing moments. Is it mountain biking? Training for a marathon? Racing? Making a money? Key takeaway is sitting and watching Netflix isn’t the refreshing you may need. Humans are naturally made to be active. Find something to keep yourself busy but keep yourself away from repetitive topic/area of work.</p>

<h3 id="key-step-four">Key step four</h3>
<p>Implement a plan. Exactly where is the limit, write that down. Convey it, express it, explain the benefits and utilize CAVE from the previous post.</p>
